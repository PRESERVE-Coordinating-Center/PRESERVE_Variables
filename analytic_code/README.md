# PRESERVE Analytic Code

This directory contains reusable analytic code developed in support of the PRESERVE project. See the table below for more information about each file and a link to its entry in the PEDSpace metadata repository.

| Variable | Brief Description | PEDSpace Link |
|----|----|----|
| [Blood Pressure Z-Score](https://github.com/PRESERVE-Coordinating-Center/PRESERVE_Variables/blob/main/analytic_code/bp_zscore.R) | A function for computing blood pressure z-scores in a given cohort of patients, which can be used to measure hypertension and blood pressure control. | <https://pedsnet.org/metadata/handle/20.500.14642/1052> |
| [Chronic Dialysis](https://github.com/PRESERVE-Coordinating-Center/PRESERVE_Variables/blob/main/analytic_code/chronic_dialysis_phenotype.R) | A phenotype to identify patients with kidney transplant based on a combination of kidney transplant and kidney biopsy procedure and condition codes, and eGFR values. | <https://pedsnet.org/metadata/handle/20.500.14642/981> |
| [Etiology of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)](https://github.com/PRESERVE-Coordinating-Center/PRESERVE_Variables/blob/main/analytic_code/ckd_etiology.R) | A function for identifying and categorizing chronic kidney disease (CKD) etiologies in a given cohort of patients. | <https://pedsnet.org/metadata/handle/20.500.14642/1055> |
| [Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR)](https://github.com/PRESERVE-Coordinating-Center/PRESERVE_Variables/blob/main/analytic_code/egfr.R) | A function to derive the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) for a cohort of patients with existing serum creatinine and height measurements. eGFR values can be used to evaluate the presence and severity of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and other kidney related conditions. | <https://pedsnet.org/metadata/handle/20.500.14642/1051> |
| [End-Stage Kidney Disease](https://github.com/PRESERVE-Coordinating-Center/PRESERVE_Variables/blob/main/analytic_code/eskd_cp_phenotype.R) | A phenotype to identify patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), defined as having either chronic dialysis or kidney transplant based on a combination of kidney transplant, kidney biopsy, and kidney dialysis procedure and condition codes, and eGFR values. | <https://pedsnet.org/metadata/handle/20.500.14642/982> |
| [Glomerular Disease](https://github.com/PRESERVE-Coordinating-Center/PRESERVE_Variables/blob/main/analytic_code/glomerular_phenotype.R) | A phenotype for identifying patients with glomerular disease based on diagnoses and kidney biopsy procedures. | <https://pedsnet.org/metadata/handle/20.500.14642/1054> |
| [Kidney Transplant](https://github.com/PRESERVE-Coordinating-Center/PRESERVE_Variables/blob/main/analytic_code/kidney_transplant_cp_USRDS.R) | A phenotype to identify patients with chronic kidney dialysis based on a combination of broad and chronic dialysis procedure and condition codes, and eGFR values. | <https://pedsnet.org/metadata/handle/20.500.14642/980> |
| [Malignancy](https://github.com/PRESERVE-Coordinating-Center/PRESERVE_Variables/blob/main/analytic_code/malignancy_phenotype.R) | A phenotype for identifying patients with malignancy based on cancer diagnoses and chemotherapy drug exposures. | <https://pedsnet.org/metadata/handle/20.500.14642/1053> |
